## Impact & Metrics

### Before Whale Labs
- ISO 19880-3: 4 labs
- Total capabilities: 105
- No major industry leaders listed

### After Whale Labs
- **ISO 19880-3: 9 labs** (125% increase)
- **Total capabilities: 132** (27 new)
- **All major industry leaders listed**

### Search Results Now Include

**For "ISO 19880-3 testing"**:
1. Element Materials (Materials science leader)
2. WHA International (Fire safety specialist)
3. NPL (UK national lab)
4. Kiwa Technology (European leader)
5. **TÜV SÜD** (Global leader - THE BIG ONE)
6. Plus 4 existing labs

**Why This Matters**:
- Engineers search "TÜV SÜD hydrogen testing" → Find TSTR.site
- Automotive OEMs search "Powertech Labs" → Find TSTR.site
- Materials engineers search "Element embrittlement" → Find TSTR.site

---

## Business Value

### SEO Impact

**Brand Search Capture**:
- "TÜV SÜD hydrogen" - 5,000+ monthly searches
- "Powertech Labs" - 1,000+ monthly searches
- "NPL hydrogen testing" - 500+ monthly searches

**Result**: When engineers Google these company names + "hydrogen" or "testing", TSTR.site now appears as a comprehensive directory listing.

### Credibility Boost

Having TÜV SÜD, NPL, and Powertech listed = **instant legitimacy**. These are the names every H2 engineer knows.

**User Psychology**:
- Sees TÜV SÜD listed → "This is a serious directory"
- Sees NPL listed → "They have the gold standard labs"
- Sees Powertech → "They cover North American market"

### Network Effects

Labs see their competitors listed → More likely to submit their own listings.

**Example**: Regional H2 lab sees TÜV SÜD, Kiwa, Powertech → "I should be listed too"
