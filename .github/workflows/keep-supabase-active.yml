# This workflow:
# 1. Runs daily at noon UTC
# 2. Creates/updates .build-trigger file
# 3. Commits change to main branch
# 4. Cloudflare detects commit → triggers build
# 5. Build queries Supabase → keeps project active
# 6. Prevents 7-day inactivity pause
#
# Note: Will be removed after migrating to Neon/PlanetScale (next week)
