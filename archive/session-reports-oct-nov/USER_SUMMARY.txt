Website             0% (0/14)        ✗ MISSING

================================================================================
THE PROBLEM: CUSTOM FIELDS MISSING
================================================================================

Expected: 67 custom field values (certifications, testing capabilities, etc.)
Received: 0 custom field values
Impact: Users can't see specialized certifications

Likely Causes:
1. Scraper not configured to extract custom fields
2. TNI data may not include structured custom field data
3. Silent error during field extraction

Fix Required:
1. Check scraper logs for errors
2. Verify TNI source includes custom fields
3. Re-run scraper with validated configuration

================================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (IN ORDER)
================================================================================

1. INVESTIGATE CUSTOM FIELDS (This Week)
   → Check scraper logs for extraction errors
   → Confirm TNI source has custom field data
   → Decide: retry scraper or source data elsewhere

2. REBUILD ASTRO SITE (ASAP)
   → Push changes to GitHub
   → Trigger Cloudflare rebuild
   → Verify environmental category appears on live site

3. TEST IN PRODUCTION (Before Launch)
   → Verify listings display correctly
   → Test category filtering
   → Check mobile responsiveness

4. SUPPLEMENT CONTACT DATA (This Month)
   → Research phone numbers for 14 labs
   → Find website URLs
   → Manual entry or secondary source lookup

5. MONITOR ENGAGEMENT (Ongoing)
   → Track visitor behavior on environmental category
   → Gather user feedback
   → Plan expansion to other testing categories

DATABASE DETAILS (If You Need Them)
================================================================================

Supabase URL: haimjeaetrsaauitrhfy.supabase.co
Environmental Testing Category ID: a80a47e9-ca57-4712-9b55-d3139b98a6b7
Total Active Listings: 14
Listings with Location Link: 12
Locations with Location ID: 12

================================================================================
DECISION POINT
================================================================================

You have three options:

A) PROCEED TO PRODUCTION (Risk: users see incomplete data)
   → Rebuild site now with current data
   → Users can see listings but no contact info
   → Urgently fix custom fields afterward

B) FIX CUSTOM FIELDS FIRST (Recommended)
   → Investigate why fields are empty
   → Get complete data before going live
   → Higher quality launch

C) PARTIAL LAUNCH (Balanced approach)
   → Launch listings + contact data with research
   → Ship custom fields in v2 when ready
   → Users get working core product

Recommendation: Option B (Fix custom fields first)
Effort to Fix: 2-4 hours investigation + rescrape
ROI: Professional launch without data gaps

================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

The infrastructure is working and the core data is clean.
The missing pieces (custom fields, contact data) are fixable.
Don't ship without fixing custom fields - it's the reason for the scraper.

Next step: Check those scraper logs and figure out where the 67 custom
field values went. They're either in the source data but not extracted,
or the source doesn't have them structured that way.
