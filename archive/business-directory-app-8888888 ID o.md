Should I promote that to Static?

Alright, it is done. However, this will cause a propagation delay which can take up to 72 hours to be completed worldwide.

I am providing you with a tutorial where you can read more about propagation:

Ussually for a Domain name transfer you need the Domain to be unlocked and set to Active , as well as the EPP code for the transfer


I can provide you with the EPP code and also set it on Active if you like

However for the transfer procedure you will need to contact Google to handle the rest

ok

All set now

The EPP Code for your domain is: imvkuyUlpxqwt-javd2wuakq
