## Why "Verified" Matters

Engineers don't trust unverified listings. When your lab displays the **"✓ Verified"** badge, it signals:

1. **Accreditation Confirmed:** Your ISO 17025, A2LA, UKAS, or equivalent credentials have been independently validated
2. **Active Operations:** Your facility is currently accepting projects (we verify contact info quarterly)
3. **Accurate Capabilities:** Your listed certifications and test methods have been cross-checked against public records

**Impact:** Verified labs receive **3-5x more clicks** than unverified entries in our analytics.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is this a pay-to-play directory?
**A:** No. The core list remains 100% community-curated and merit-based. Sponsorship provides **visibility and verification**, not inclusion. Free community submissions are always accepted — sponsored entries simply receive priority review and enhanced placement.

### Q: What if my lab doesn't have ISO 17025 accreditation?
**A:** Verification requires **at least one** recognized accreditation: ISO 17025, A2LA, UKAS, NATA, NVLAP, or equivalent national body. If you have industry-specific certifications (NADCAP, GMP, FDA registration), contact us to discuss eligibility.

### Q: Can I cancel Lab Partner or Corporate Sponsor anytime?
**A:** Yes. Cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. Your listing remains in the directory but reverts to standard (non-sponsored) format.

### Q: How do I track ROI?
**A:** Lab Partners and Corporate Sponsors receive monthly analytics reports showing: profile views, outbound clicks, geographic traffic sources, and top search keywords driving visitors to your listing. Use UTM parameters on your booking page URL to track conversions in Google Analytics.

### Q: What if a competitor sponsors my category?
**A:** Multiple sponsors per category are allowed. Placement rotates monthly to ensure fairness (Lab Partners) or is determined by sponsorship tier (Corporate Sponsors always appear first). We never grant category exclusivity.

### Q: Do you verify competitor claims?
**A:** Yes. All sponsored listings undergo quarterly audits. If a lab falsely claims certifications or capabilities, they are immediately removed and refunds are forfeited. We protect the integrity of this list aggressively.
