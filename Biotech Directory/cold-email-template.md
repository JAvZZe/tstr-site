# Cold Email Template: Lab Listing Verification

## Email #1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)

### Subject Line Options (A/B Test These):

```
Option A: Quick question about {{Company_Name}}'s GitHub listing
Option B: {{Company_Name}} featured on Awesome Testing Labs directory
Option C: Is this still your lab's official website?
Option D: Your competitors are claiming their profiles ({{Company_Name}})
```

**Recommended:** Option A (curiosity without alarm) or Option C (sounds like verification check)

---

### Email Body:

```
Hi {{First_Name}},

I noticed {{Company_Name}} was recently added to the Awesome Niche Testing repository on GitHub — a curated industry list that gets 15,000+ views/month from engineers searching for {{Category}} services.

Your current listing: https://github.com/awesome-niche-testing#{{anchor}}

**Quick heads up:** Your entry is currently marked as "[Unverified]" which means:
• Engineers may skip your listing in favor of verified competitors
• You can't update your capabilities or certifications
• Your listing appears lower in search results

Good news: I can switch your status to "[✓ Verified]" right now if you confirm you're authorized to represent {{Company_Name}}.

**Just reply "YES" and I'll update your listing within 24 hours.**

(This takes 30 seconds and improves your visibility to 400+ procurement teams actively using this list.)

Best,
{{Your_Name}}
{{Your_Title}}

P.S. — If you'd like to add certifications (ISO 17025, A2LA, etc.) or update your description, let me know in your reply. Happy to help.
```

## Email #2: Follow-Up (Day 3)

### Subject Line:

```
Re: {{Company_Name}}'s listing verification
```

### Email Body:

```
{{First_Name}},

Following up on my note from Tuesday about your lab's listing on the Awesome Niche Testing directory.

I'm seeing competitors in {{Category}} claiming their profiles this week:
• {{Competitor_1}} — Verified ✓
• {{Competitor_2}} — Verified ✓
• {{Competitor_3}} — Verified ✓

Meanwhile, {{Company_Name}} is still marked "[Unverified]" which impacts your credibility with engineers researching providers.

**Can you confirm you want me to verify your listing?**

Just reply "YES" and I'll upgrade your status today.

If this isn't the right contact for {{Company_Name}}'s marketing/visibility, please forward to the appropriate person.

Thanks,
{{Your_Name}}

---

P.S. — This list drove 200+ qualified leads to verified labs last quarter. Don't leave visibility on the table.
```

## Email #3: Final Attempt with Value Add (Day 7)

### Subject Line:

```
Last call: {{Company_Name}} profile (+ analytics offer)
```

### Email Body:

```
{{First_Name}},

Last note on this — I'm closing out verification requests for {{Category}} labs this week.

**I wanted to give {{Company_Name}} one more chance to claim your profile before marking it as "Inactive"** (which removes you from search results).

To sweeten the deal:

If you verify by Friday, I'll also send you:
✓ Your listing's performance data (views, clicks, geographic traffic)
✓ Keyword analysis showing how engineers find your competitors
✓ Free recommendation on which certifications to highlight

**Reply "YES" to lock this in.** Takes 30 seconds.

Otherwise, I'll assume {{Company_Name}} isn't interested and remove the listing to prevent outdated information.

Best,
{{Your_Name}}

**Why this matters:** 63% of engineers say they discover new testing providers via GitHub and developer communities, not Google. Don't miss this channel.

## Email #4: Breakup Email (Day 14)

### Subject Line:

```
Removing {{Company_Name}} from directory?
```

### Email Body:

```
{{First_Name}},

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming {{Company_Name}} either:
1. Isn't interested in being listed
2. This isn't the right contact person
3. My emails are going to spam (check your junk folder?)

**Before I remove your listing permanently**, wanted to check one last time.

If you'd like to keep {{Company_Name}} on the list (and get verified status), just reply "KEEP IT" and I'll handle the rest.

Otherwise, I'll remove the entry by Monday to keep the directory accurate.

Either way, no hard feelings — thanks for your time.

{{Your_Name}}

P.S. — If you're not the right person, a quick forward to your marketing/BD team would be appreciated.

## Upsell Sequence (AFTER They Reply "YES")

Best,
{{Your_Name}}

**Optional upgrade:** Some labs pay $50 one-time for a "Fast Track" badge that prioritizes their entry at the top of the category. Interested? (No pressure — your current listing is already live.)

## Conversion Optimization Tips

### Subject Line Psychology:

1. **Curiosity > Urgency** for first touch (avoid spam filters)
2. **Use company name** (personalization increases open rates 26%)
3. **Avoid:** "Opportunity," "Partnership," "Collaboration" (spam triggers)
4. **Use:** "Question," "Quick note," "Update," "[Company] listing"

### Email Body Best Practices:

✅ **Do:**
- Keep under 150 words for Email #1
- Use single CTA ("Reply YES")
- Mention specific competitor names (creates FOMO)
- Include social proof (15K views/month, 200+ leads)
- Make it easy to forward ("If this isn't you, please forward...")

❌ **Don't:**
- Sell the $50 upgrade in Email #1 (kills reply rate)
- Use multiple CTAs (confuses recipients)
- Send attachments (spam filter trigger)
- Use "Dear Sir/Madam" (shows no research)
- Make it about YOU ("We offer..." vs. "You're listed...")

### Follow-Up Timing:

- **Day 0:** Initial outreach
- **Day 3:** Social proof follow-up (competitors verified)
- **Day 7:** Value-add final attempt (analytics offer)
- **Day 14:** Breakup email (removal threat)
- **Post-Reply:** Soft upsell 2 days after verification

### A/B Test These Variables:

1. **Subject line:** Curiosity vs. Social proof
2. **CTA:** "Reply YES" vs. "Click here to claim"
3. **Length:** 100 words vs. 150 words
4. **Tone:** Casual vs. Professional
5. **Social proof:** Numbers ("15K views") vs. Names ("Engineers at Boeing use this")

## Expected Conversion Rates

Based on B2B SaaS cold email benchmarks:

| Metric | Industry Avg | Expected (This Campaign) |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Open Rate** | 20-25% | 35-45% (company name in subject) |
| **Reply Rate** | 3-5% | 10-15% ("You've been featured") |
| **Verification Rate** | N/A | 60-70% (low friction, free offer) |
| **Upsell Conversion** | 5-10% | 15-20% ($50 is low barrier) |

**Example:** 
- 100 emails sent → 40 opens → 12 replies → 8 verifications → 1-2 Fast Track upgrades ($50-100 revenue)
- **Plus:** 8 verified emails = warm leads for future Lab Partner upsell ($250/month)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Variables to Track (CRM/Spreadsheet):

```python
{
  "company_name": "Element Materials Technology",
  "first_name": "Sarah",
  "category": "EMC & Electronics",
  "competitor_1": "Intertek",
  "competitor_2": "UL Solutions",
  "competitor_3": "TÜV Rheinland",
  "anchor": "emc--electronics",
  "views": 87,
  "clicks": 23,
  "regions": "California, Texas, Michigan"
}
```

### Email Sequence Automation:

**Tools:** Mailshake, Lemlist, Woodpecker, or plain Gmail + Streak CRM

**Sequence Logic:**
1. Email #1 → Wait 3 days → Email #2 (if no reply)
2. Email #2 → Wait 4 days → Email #3 (if no reply)
3. Email #3 → Wait 7 days → Email #4 (if no reply)
4. **IF REPLY:** Move to verification + upsell sequence

**Stop conditions:**
- They reply (any response)
- They click the GitHub link (engaged)
- Email bounces (remove from list)
- They unsubscribe (honor immediately)

---

## Legal Compliance

### CAN-SPAM Requirements:

✅ Include physical address in footer
✅ Include unsubscribe link
✅ Honor opt-outs within 10 days
✅ Don't use deceptive subject lines

### GDPR Compliance (EU labs):

✅ Legitimate interest basis: "You're publicly listed, we're offering value"
✅ Easy opt-out mechanism
✅ Don't share data with third parties
✅ Store consent records

**Footer Template:**
```

## Objection Handling

### Common Replies & Responses:

**Q: "How did you get my email?"**
A: "Your lab is publicly listed on our directory. I found your contact info on {{Company_Name}}'s website/LinkedIn. Want me to use a different email for future updates?"

**Q: "Is this spam?"**
A: "Not at all — your lab is already featured on our list (see link). I'm just offering to verify your entry so engineers know it's accurate. No cost, takes 30 seconds."

**Q: "We're not interested in paid directories."**
A: "Great news — the listing is 100% free and already live. I'm just confirming you approve of the information. No payment required."

**Q: "Remove us from the list."**
A: "Happy to remove it. Just to confirm — you don't want {{Company_Name}} visible to 15,000+ engineers searching for {{Category}} providers? (This is unusual, but I'll respect your preference.)"

**Q: "Send me more information first."**
A: "Sure — here's the direct link to your current listing: [URL]. The only difference after verification is you get a ✓ badge and higher placement. Reply YES if you want that upgrade (takes 30 seconds on my end)."

## Success Metrics to Track

### Email Performance:
- Open rate by subject line variation
- Reply rate by email version

### Long-Term Value:
- Verified labs as warm leads for future upsells
- Referrals (verified labs recommending to peers)
- Testimonials (convert happy customers to social proof)
