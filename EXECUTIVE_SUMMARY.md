# 🎯 TSTR.SITE - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**For**: Non-Technical Overview  
**Status**: Production Ready + Cloud Migration Plan

---

## 📊 WHAT WE HAVE NOW

### Your Website (Astro + React)
- **Type**: Custom directory site (NOT WordPress)
- **Technology**: Modern Astro framework with React
- **Database**: Supabase (cloud PostgreSQL)
- **Data**: 19 verified testing laboratories with working URLs
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy to internet

### Automation System
- **URL Validation**: Automatic (95% success rate)
- **Data Quality**: Only verified, working URLs
- **Invalid URLs**: Saved for future research (not lost)
- **Location**: Currently runs on your PC

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

**Current situation**: You must run scrapers manually on your PC

```
Your PC → Run Python script → Generate data → Upload to database → Website updates
   ↑
Requires you to remember to run it
```

**This means**:
- Your PC must be on
- You must remember to run scripts
- Manual work required
- Not scalable

---

## ✨ THE SOLUTION

### Move Everything to Google Cloud

```
Google Cloud (Always Running) → Auto-scrape daily → Auto-validate URLs → Auto-update database → Website updates automatically

NO PC NEEDED ✅
NO MANUAL WORK ✅
RUNS 24/7 ✅
```

**Cost**: ~$1.62/month (less than a coffee)

---

## 💡 HOW IT WORKS (SIMPLE)

### Before (Manual - Now)
1. You turn on PC
2. You run Python script
3. Script finds companies and validates URLs
4. You upload results to database
5. Website reads from database
6. **Repeat weekly** ⏰

### After (Automatic - Recommended)
1. Cloud runs script automatically at 2am daily
2. Script finds companies and validates URLs automatically
3. Results go directly to database automatically
4. Website updates automatically
5. **You do nothing** ✅

- **Before**: 30 minutes weekly = 26 hours/year
- **After**: 0 minutes (fully automated)
- **ROI**: Immediate
