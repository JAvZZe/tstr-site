# 🚀 DEPLOY TO NETLIFY - DO THIS NOW!

**Your code is ready!** ✅ Follow these steps to go live.

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (3 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in**:
   - Repository name: `tstr-site`

   - **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)

3. **Click**: "Create repository"

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Push Your Code to GitHub (2 minutes)

GitHub will show you commands. **Copy your GitHub username** from the URL, then run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\alber\OneDrive\Documents\.WORK\TSTR.site

# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tstr-site.git

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main
```

**Example**: If your username is `johnsmith`, use:
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/johnsmith/tstr-site.git
```
