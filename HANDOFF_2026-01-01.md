# HANDOFF: Payment System Deployment Ready

> **Date**: 2026-01-01
> **Agent**: Gemini (Antigravity)
> **Status**: Analysis complete, ready for deployment
> **Priority**: 🚨 CRITICAL - Only blocker to revenue

---

## Session Summary

Completed full project bootstrap and status review. PayPal integration code is complete (v2.4.0) but not deployed. Evaluated Upmind.com as alternative billing platform - recommended to defer until 50+ subscribers.

---

## Key Finding

**TSTR.directory is code-complete for payments but hasn't deployed.**

The only thing between the project and first revenue is:
1. PayPal Dashboard configuration (15 min manual work)
2. Deployment commands (15 min)
3. Testing (15 min)

---

## Immediate Next Steps for Next Agent

### Option A: Deploy PayPal (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. User creates plans in PayPal Dashboard first, then:

# 2. Deploy database migration
cd /media/al/AI_DATA/AI_PROJECTS_SPACE/ACTIVE_PROJECTS/TSTR-site/tstr-site-working/web/tstr-frontend
supabase db push

# 3. Set secrets (user provides Plan IDs and Webhook ID)
supabase secrets set PAYPAL_PLAN_PROFESSIONAL=P-xxx
supabase secrets set PAYPAL_PLAN_PREMIUM=P-xxx
supabase secrets set PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID=xxx

# 4. Deploy Edge Functions
supabase functions deploy paypal-create-subscription
supabase functions deploy paypal-webhook
supabase functions deploy paypal-cancel-subscription

# 5. Test
# Visit /pricing, click Subscribe, complete sandbox checkout
```

### Option B: Pivot to Upmind

If user decides on Upmind instead, create new implementation plan. See `PAYMENT_PLATFORM_ANALYSIS.md` for effort estimate (~12-24 hours).
