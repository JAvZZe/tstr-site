---

## Phase 2: Scale & Optimise (Month 2-3) - TARGET: £3,000/month

### Lead Generation Model (Higher Margin)

Instead of just listing fees, **sell qualified leads**:

**How it works:**
1. Testing labs pay **£20-50 per qualified lead**
2. Qualified = Contact info + Service needed + Budget + Timeline
3. You capture these via "Request Quote" forms
4. Forward to relevant labs in that geography + specialty

**Why this works:**
- Oil & Gas testing contracts = £10k-500k+ average
- Pharma testing = £5k-100k per project
- Labs gladly pay £50 for a £50k opportunity
- **Your margin:** 95%+ (just email forwarding)

**Revenue Model:**
- 20 leads/week × £40/lead = £800/week = **£3,200/month**
- Plus subscription fees: £1,500/month
- **Total: £4,700/month by Month 3**

---

## Phase 3: Automation & Expansion (Month 4-6) - TARGET: £10,000/month

### Multiple Revenue Streams

**1. Subscription Listings** - £3,000/month
   - 40 Featured @ £50 = £2,000
   - 5 Premium @ £200 = £1,000

**2. Lead Generation** - £5,000/month
   - 100 leads/month @ £50 = £5,000

**3. Sponsored Content** - £1,500/month
   - "Top 10 Testing Labs in Houston" = £500/post
   - 3 posts/month = £1,500

**4. Banner Advertising** - £500/month
   - Equipment suppliers, software vendors
   - £100/month × 5 positions

**Total Month 6: £10,000/month recurring**

## Geographic Expansion Strategy

### Priority Markets (High Margin)

**Tier 1 (Month 1-3):**
- United States (Houston, New Jersey, California)
- United Kingdom (Aberdeen, Cambridge, London)
- **Why:** Highest testing budgets, English-speaking

**Tier 2 (Month 4-6):**
- UAE (Dubai) - Oil & gas hub
- Singapore - Petrochemical centre
- Germany - Pharmaceutical strength
- **Why:** High budgets, English business language

**Tier 3 (Month 7-12):**
- India, China, Brazil, Norway, Netherlands
- **Why:** Growing markets, emerging demand

### Subdomain Strategy

As you grow, split into focused sites:
- **oilgas.tstr.directory** → Oil & Gas testing only
- **pharma.tstr.directory** → Pharmaceutical testing
- **biotech.tstr.directory** → Biotech testing
- **enviro.tstr.directory** → Environmental testing

**Benefits:**
- Better SEO (niche authority)
- Easier to sell (focused value proposition)
- Can sell entire subdomain as business exit

## SEO Strategy (Free Traffic = Free Customers)

### Target Keywords (Low Competition, High Intent)

**Tier 1 Keywords** (0-100 monthly searches, easy wins):
- "oil pipeline testing laboratory Houston"
- "ISO 17025 pharma testing New Jersey"
- "biotech analytical testing San Francisco"
- "environmental soil testing California"

**Content Strategy:**
1. **Location + Service pages** (auto-generated)
   - Each listing creates: "Testing Labs in [City]"
   - Each category creates: "[Service] Testing in [City]"
   - 100 listings × 5 categories = 500 pages indexed

2. **Long-tail content** (monthly blog posts)
   - "How to Choose an ISO 17025 Accredited Lab"
   - "Oil Pipeline Testing Requirements by Country"
   - "Pharmaceutical Stability Testing Guidelines"
   - **Goal:** Attract buyers researching before purchase

3. **Comparison pages** (high conversion)
   - "Top 10 Oil & Gas Testing Labs in Houston"
   - "Best Pharmaceutical Testing Labs UK"
   - Labs pay £200-500 to be included in these

### Google Search Console Setup

1. Add property: tstr.directory
2. Submit sitemap: http://34.100.223.247/sitemap.xml
3. Request indexing for key pages
4. Monitor: Clicks, Impressions, CTR

**Target Month 1:** 100 clicks/day from organic search
