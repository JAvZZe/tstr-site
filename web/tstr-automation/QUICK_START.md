### Outreach at Scale

### SEO Content (2 posts/week)

---

## MONTH 2-3: £1,000-£3,000/month

### Switch Focus: Lead Generation

**Higher Margin Model:**

Instead of selling listings, sell **qualified leads**:

1. Add "Request Quote" forms to every listing
2. Capture: Name, Email, Service needed, Budget, Timeline
3. Sell leads to labs at £20-50 each
4. Forward via email (zero cost, 95% margin)

**Math:**
- 5 leads/week × £40 = £200/week = £800/month
- Plus subscriptions: £500/month
- **Total: £1,300/month**

### Automation

**Set Up Weekly Auto-Scraping:**
```bash
python auto_updater.py
```
This runs in background and:
- Scrapes 50 new listings every Sunday
- Monitors competitors daily
- Generates SEO reports weekly

**Result:** Hands-free content updates
