# tstr.directory - TOMORROW'S DEPLOYMENT FIX

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

Cloudflare Pages keeps connecting to the WRONG GitHub repository:
- ❌ Wrong: `Tstr-site/tstrsite` (old/incorrect repo)
- ✅ Correct: `JAvZZe/tstr-site` (your actual code)

---

## ✅ SOLUTION - STEP BY STEP

### Step 1: Delete the Failed Project

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click "Workers & Pages" in sidebar
3. Find the project called "tstr-site" or "tstrsite"
4. Click on it
5. Go to "Settings" tab
6. Scroll to bottom
7. Click "Delete project"
8. Confirm deletion

### Step 2: Start Fresh

1. Go back to "Workers & Pages"
2. Click "Create application"
3. Click "Pages" tab
4. Click "Connect to Git"

### Step 3: Select CORRECT Repository

**CRITICAL:** Make sure you select: **JAvZZe/tstr-site**

NOT "Tstr-site/tstrsite"

### Step 4: Configure Build Settings

**Project name:** `tstr-site-live` (or any unique name)

**Production branch:** `main`

**Framework preset:** `Astro` (from dropdown)

**Build command:** (auto-fills to) `npm run build`

**Build output directory:** (auto-fills to) `dist`

**Root directory:** LEAVE EMPTY (very important!)

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables

Click "Environment variables (advanced)"

Add these TWO variables:

**Variable 1:**
```
Name: PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
Value: https://haimjeaetrsaauitrhfy.supabase.co
```

**Variable 2:**
```
Name: PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: sb_publishable_nFGCy-22_7FQlVr_SkJ6cQ_mwfYVhA4
```

### Step 6: Deploy

Click "Save and Deploy"

Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete.

You should see:
- ✅ Success! Your site is live at: https://tstr-site-live.pages.dev

---

## 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY CORRECT REPOSITORY

When selecting repository, look for:
- Repository name: **tstr-site** or **tstrsite**
- Owner: **JAvZZe** (NOT "Tstr-site")
- Should show your recent commit: "Initial commit - tstr.directory MVP"

---

## 📊 WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR

✅ Database fully set up (Supabase)
✅ Code written and working locally
✅ Code pushed to GitHub (JAvZZe/tstr-site)
✅ All build settings configured correctly

❌ Just need to connect to the RIGHT repository in Cloudflare

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULT

After following these steps, you'll have:
1. Your site live at: `https://tstr-site-live.pages.dev`
2. Categories showing from Supabase database
3. Professional design visible
4. Ready to point tstr.directory domain to it

Then we can:
1. Add your custom domain (tstr.directory)
2. Import first listings via scraper
3. Start revenue generation (featured listings @ £50/month)

---

## 💡 KEY LESSON

Always verify the repository owner and name when connecting to Cloudflare Pages.

The repository dropdown should clearly show:
**JAvZZe / tstr-site**

NOT "Tstr-site/tstrsite"

---

## ⏱️ TIME ESTIMATE TOMORROW

- Delete old project: 2 minutes
- Create new deployment: 5 minutes
- Build and deploy: 3 minutes
- **Total: 10 minutes to live site**

---

Good luck! When you're back, just follow Steps 1-6 above.
