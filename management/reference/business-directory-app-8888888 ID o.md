34.55.31.102 that's the external I could find in the VPC networks

Should I promote that to Static?

Ivan S.

If you are sure that this is the correct IP Address I can assist you with pointing the domain.

You need to provide me with the IP Address of the server from where the content of the website will be loading.

I'm guessing, following Gemini's instructions.

Ivan S.

Please, follow my advice and contact the support of the company whose free platform you are using as they can provide you with the correct details.

It is my company. I am using Google Cloud. Doing it myself.

Ivan S.

Should I proceed pointing the domain using the IP Address that you provided me with?

avatar

yes

Ivan S.

Allow me a few moments, please.

thanks

Alright, it is done. However, this will cause a propagation delay which can take up to 72 hours to be completed worldwide.

I am providing you with a tutorial where you can read more about propagation:

Ussually for a Domain name transfer you need the Domain to be unlocked and set to Active , as well as the EPP code for the transfer



I can provide you with the EPP code and also set it on Active if you like

However for the transfer procedure you will need to contact Google to handle the rest

Marin K.

ok

All set now

The EPP Code for your domain is: imvkuyUlpxqwt-javd2wuakq
