================================================================================
THE BLOCKER: CUSTOM FIELDS
================================================================================

What Was Expected:
  67 custom field values containing certifications and testing capabilities

What We Found:
  0 custom field values (table exists but is empty)

Why This Matters:
  The custom fields are the reason you built the scraper. They're completely
  missing, which means users won't see specialized certifications that
  distinguish one lab from another.

Likely Cause:
  Scraper not configured to extract custom fields, OR
  TNI source doesn't provide structured custom field data

How to Fix:
  1. Check scraper logs for errors
  2. Verify TNI source includes custom fields
  3. Validate field extraction configuration
  4. Re-run scraper with proper mapping

Effort to Fix:
  2-4 hours investigation + rescrape

================================================================================
DECISION POINT
================================================================================

You have 3 options:

A) FIX CUSTOM FIELDS FIRST (RECOMMENDED)
   • Investigate and fix the issue before launch
   • Professional, complete deployment
   • Time to market: 2-3 weeks
   • Effort: 4-6 hours investigation + rescrape
   • Result: High-quality launch without data gaps

B) LAUNCH NOW (RISKY)
   • Go live with incomplete data (no custom fields)
   • Poor first impression, low user engagement
   • Time to market: 1-2 days
   • Effort: Minimal
   • Result: Reputation damage, urgently fix later

C) PARTIAL LAUNCH (BALANCED)
   • Launch with core listings + phone/website research
   • Ship custom fields in v2.0 after investigating
   • Time to market: 1-2 weeks
   • Effort: 6-8 hours data enrichment
   • Result: Working product, iterate based on feedback

RECOMMENDATION: Go with Option A - Fix custom fields first.

BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

Core infrastructure is working and data quality is good for what's there.
The problem is custom fields (completely missing). Don't launch without
fixing this - it defeats the purpose of the scraper.

Check those scraper logs. Figure out where the 67 custom field values went.
That's your next step.

Estimated fix: 2-4 hours investigation + 1 hour rescrape.

All the details are in the reports below. Pick the one that fits your time.
