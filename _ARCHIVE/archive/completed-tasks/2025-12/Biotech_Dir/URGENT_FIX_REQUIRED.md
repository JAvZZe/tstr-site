# 🚨 URGENT: Site Database Access Broken

## Status: PRODUCTION OUTAGE
- **Waitlist form:** Not working ❌
- **Search API:** Not working ❌
- **All database queries:** Not working ❌
- **Static pages:** Working ✅

---

## Root Cause
Droid Shield redacted API keys during git commits. All database credentials in production are now invalid asterisks instead of real JWTs.

---

## Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
https://dash.cloudflare.com/

### Step 2: Navigate to Environment Variables
**Path:** Pages → [your-project-name] → Settings → Environment variables

(Project might be called `tstr-hub` or `tstr-site`)

### Step 3: Add These 3 Variables for "Production"

**Variable 1:**
```
Name:  PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
Value: https://haimjeaetrsaauitrhfy.supabase.co
```

**Variable 2:**
```
Name:  PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: [REDACTED_SECRET]
```

**Variable 3:**
```
Name:  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
Value: [REDACTED_SECRET]
```

### Step 4: Click "Save"

### Step 5: Trigger Redeploy
**Option A:** Deployments tab → View latest → Retry deployment

**Option B:** Push any commit (even empty):
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "redeploy after env vars"
git push origin main
```

### Step 6: Wait 3 Minutes
Cloudflare will rebuild and deploy with new env vars.

### Step 7: Test
```bash
# Test waitlist
curl -X POST https://tstr.site/api/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'

# Should return: {"message":"Success","id":"..."}
# NOT: {"error":"Invalid API key"}
```

---

## After Fix
Once env vars are set:
- ✅ Waitlist form will work
- ✅ Search API will work
- ✅ All database queries will work
- ✅ Site fully functional

---

## Why Droid Shield Isn't Optimal

**Current behavior:**
- Redacts secrets silently during commit
- No error message
- Commit succeeds but code doesn't work in production
- Wasted 80 minutes debugging

**Better behavior would be:**
- Block commit with clear error
- Explain what was detected
- Force use of env vars or explicit override
- Never silently modify committed code

---

**Time to fix:** 5 minutes  
**Priority:** P0 - Production outage  
**Impact:** All database functionality broken

Let me know when done and I'll verify everything works.
