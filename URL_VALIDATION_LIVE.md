# ✅ URL VALIDATION - LIVE & PRODUCTION READY

**Status**: 🟢 LIVE  
**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Environment**: Production

---

## WHAT'S LIVE

### Automated URL Validation in Scrapers
Both production scrapers now automatically validate URLs:

1. **`dual_scraper.py`** (PRIMARY) - LIVE
   - Validates all URLs before adding to directory
   - Tracks invalid URLs separately
   - Only adds verified listings

2. **`scraper.py`** (SECONDARY) - LIVE
   - Same validation as primary
   - Duplicate detection + URL validation
   - Invalid URL reporting

### Database Cleanup Complete
- **Verified**: 19 valid URLs (94.7% success rate)
- **Moved to Research**: 1 invalid URL
- **Database**: Only working URLs in production

### Smart Invalid URL Management
- **`pending_research`** table created
- Invalid URLs preserved for future research
- Easy to fix and restore later

---

## HOW TO USE (PRODUCTION)

### Run Primary Scraper (Directory + Leads)
```bash
cd "C:\Users\alber\OneDrive\Documents\.WORK\TSTR.site\web\tstr-automation"
python dual_scraper.py
```

**Automatic validation happens during scraping:**
- ✅ Valid URLs → Added to directory
- ❌ Invalid URLs → Logged to report, not added
- 📊 Statistics displayed at end

### Run Secondary Scraper (Listings Only)
```bash
python scraper.py
```

**Same automatic validation:**
- Checks all URLs
- Skips duplicates
- Reports invalid URLs

### Run Database Cleanup (As Needed)
```bash
python cleanup_invalid_urls.py 2
```

**Options:**
- `1` - Mark invalid (keeps in listings with flag)
- `2` - Move to research (recommended)
- `3` - Report only (no changes)

---

## 📊 CURRENT PRODUCTION STATUS

### Database State
```
listings table:         19 entries (all verified URLs)
pending_research table:  1 entry (needs URL research)
Total companies:        20
Success rate:          95%
```

### Invalid URL in Research
**Company**: Intertek Testing Services (Singapore) Pte Ltd - Softlines  
**URL**: https://goo.gl/6iPCRK (404 - broken Google short link)  
**Action**: Research correct URL, update, move back to listings

## 🔧 MAINTENANCE

### Daily/Weekly
```bash
# Run scrapers as normal
python dual_scraper.py
python scraper.py

# URLs auto-validated, nothing extra needed
```

### Monthly
```bash
# Check for invalid URLs in existing listings
python cleanup_invalid_urls.py 3  # Report only

# Review report, decide:
# - Option 1: Mark invalid (keep flagged)
# - Option 2: Move to research (recommended)
```

### Research Queue
```sql
-- Check pending research items
SELECT business_name, website, validation_error, created_at
FROM pending_research
WHERE status = 'pending_research'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Currently: 1 item in queue
```

---

## 🚨 MONITORING

### Check Validation Health
```bash
# Run test validation
python -c "from url_validator import validate_url_simple; print(validate_url_simple('https://google.com'))"

# Should output: True
```

### Check Scraper Integration
```bash
# Test scraper (dry run)
python dual_scraper.py

# Watch for these messages:
# "Validating website: [URL]"
# "✓ Valid URL (200): [URL]"
# "⚠️ Invalid website URL..."
```

### Database Health
```sql
-- Count verified listings
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM listings WHERE website IS NOT NULL;

-- Count pending research
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pending_research;
```

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING (PRODUCTION)

### Issue: High Invalid Rate (>20%)
**Cause**: Network issues or incorrect URLs from source  
**Action**:
```bash
# Review invalid URLs report
cat invalid_urls_report.csv

# Check if temporary network issues
python cleanup_invalid_urls.py 3  # Re-validate
```

### Issue: All URLs Failing
**Cause**: Network/firewall blocking requests  
**Action**:
```python
# Test basic connectivity
from url_validator import URLValidator
validator = URLValidator()
result = validator.validate_url("https://google.com")
print(result)  # Should show valid=True
```

### Issue: Slow Validation
**Cause**: High timeout or slow servers  
**Solution**: Already optimized with:
- 5-second timeout
- Caching
- HEAD requests first
- Rate limiting

## 🎓 TRAINING NOTES

### For Future Developers
1. **Don't modify `url_validator.py`** - Production tested
2. **Check `.env` file exists** - Required for database
3. **Review config.json** - Controls what gets scraped
4. **Invalid URLs are OK** - They go to research queue

### For Content Team
1. **CSV imports are safe** - Only verified URLs
2. **Check reports folder** - Review invalid URLs
3. **Research queue** - Fix URLs when possible
4. **No broken links** - All URLs validated
