## 🔔 IMPORTANT REMINDER: Google Analytics Consent Mode

### When You Add Google Analytics (Future)

**Before adding Analytics tracking:**

1. **Go to AdSense Dashboard**
   - Settings → Privacy & messaging → European regulations

2. **Enable Analytics Consent Mode**
   - ✅ Check: "Enable consent mode for analytics purposes"
   - This interprets TCF Purpose 1 signal for analytics storage

3. **Update Privacy Policy** (/privacy page)
   - Add specific Google Analytics disclosures:
     - What data Analytics collects (pageviews, sessions, demographics)
     - How long data is retained (default: 14 months)
     - User's right to opt-out
     - Link to Google Analytics privacy policy

4. **Add Analytics Code to Site**
   - I'll help add the tracking code when ready
   - Will respect consent mode settings automatically

### Why This Matters
- **Legal compliance:** GDPR requires explicit consent for analytics
- **User trust:** Transparent about tracking
- **Better data:** Consent mode helps optimize with limited data
- **Required:** Not enabling = potential GDPR violations

### Current Status
❌ **Analytics consent mode: NOT enabled** (correct - Analytics not installed yet)
✅ **Advertising consent mode: Enabled** (correct - AdSense is active)

**Action:** Enable Analytics consent mode when you add Google Analytics (not before)
