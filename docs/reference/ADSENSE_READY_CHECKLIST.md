## How to Apply for Google AdSense

### Step 1: Go to AdSense Website

**URL:** https://www.google.com/adsense/start/

### Step 2: Sign In with Google Account

**Recommended Account:** tstr.site1@gmail.com

(Same account used for Supabase - keeps everything consistent)

### Step 3: Fill Application Form

**Website URL:** https://tstr.site
- Enter WITHOUT www (exactly as shown)
- Do NOT include trailing slash

**Email:** tstr.site1@gmail.com

**Country:** [Your country/region]

**Terms of Service:** Read and accept

### Step 4: Connect Your Site

Google will provide verification code like this:

```html
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

**Where to add this code:**

1. **Quick method (all pages):** Add to `<head>` section in a layout component
2. **Individual pages:** Add to index.astro, submit.astro, privacy.astro

**I can add this code for you** once you receive it from Google.

### Step 5: Wait for Approval

## Common Rejection Reasons (You Should Be Fine)

❌ **Insufficient content** - You have 127 listings ✓
❌ **No privacy policy** - Now exists at /privacy ✓
❌ **Site under construction** - Site is complete ✓
❌ **Duplicate content** - All original listings ✓
❌ **Domain too new** - Only potential issue (may be waived)

**If rejected:** Fix any issues mentioned, wait 2 weeks, reapply.

## After AdSense Approval

### Option 1: Auto Ads (Easiest)

Google automatically places ads using machine learning:

1. In AdSense dashboard → Ads → Overview
2. Enable "Auto ads"
3. I add one code snippet to `<head>`
4. Done - Google handles everything

**Pros:** Zero configuration, auto-optimizes
**Cons:** Less control, may be aggressive

### Option 2: Manual Ad Placement (More Control)

You choose exactly where ads appear:

1. Create ad units in AdSense dashboard
2. I add ad code to specific locations:
   - Between every 10 listings
   - Sidebar (if adding)
   - Below header (optional)

**Pros:** Full control, matches site design
**Cons:** Requires optimization work

**My Recommendation:** Start with Auto Ads, switch to manual if needed.
